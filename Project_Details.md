 Challenge: Seismic Detection Across the Solar System

## About the Challenge
Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

## High-Level Summary
In this project, we developed a model based on LSTM neural networks to detect seismic events in data collected by seismometers on the Moon and Mars. The main challenge lies in the difficulty of transferring large volumes of data from distant celestial bodies, where only a fraction of that data contains useful seismic signals. Our solution focuses on processing the data within the lander itself to differentiate seismic signals from noise, allowing only the most relevant measurements to be sent back to Earth. This approach is crucial for optimizing the use of energy resources and maximizing the scientific efficiency of space missions. By automatically detecting earthquakes in real time, we significantly reduce the amount of unnecessary data transmitted, enabling a deeper exploration of the seismic nature of planets like Mars and rocky bodies like the Moon. These studies are essential to better understanding the internal structure and tectonic processes that formed these bodies, providing new insights into the formation of rocky planets throughout the solar system.
